Hello there. I'm Rishabh Dahale. When writing this post, I'm a final year undergraduate student at the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay. I'm pursuing a Dual Degree program with a specialization in Communication and Signal Processing. For my final year thesis project, I'm working under [Prof. Preeti Rao](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/prao) on Automatic-Music Generation using Reinforcement Learning. 
Through this blog, I intend to share my projects and, at times, some other interesting research papers and topics I come across. You can fork the original repo from [this link](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).


This is a short post linked to a colab notebook with image style transfer using neural network code. This is because if you check one of my picture [here](/assets/img/prof_pic.png), you will notice it's edited. The catch is that I didn't apply the filter on my own or use very sophisticated software like adobe lightroom or anything for it. Instead, I simply gave my image and another image whose style I wanted on my picture to a neural network. More specifically, I have used the method proposed in [this paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). You can find the code for this implementation in this [github repo](https://github.com/RishabhDahale/Image-Style-Transfer-using-CNN). Some might say it's a bit old method for 2021, and more robust methods are published, so why not use them. Well, I implemented this about 2 years ago and had the code with me. And moreover, I use google colab for running such intensive operations. Newer methods would surely give better results but with added time cost.

[<strong>This is the link</strong>](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z170lOzHUs8ZGCcnI3_HfF8mKjsXWvia?usp=sharing) to the colab notebook for the same if you want to run it. You will have to copy the notebook before running it, as I have shared the view-only version.

Can't wait to share my thoughts through this blog!
