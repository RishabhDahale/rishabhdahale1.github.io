Hi everyone, I'm Rishabh Dahale, and I'm passionate about building things from scratch—whether it's personal portfolio trackers, chat platforms, or the exciting new projects I'm currently working on.

In 2022, I completed both my bachelor's and master's at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), where I had the opportunity to work on some fascinating projects, like music generation and audio steganography. My professional journey includes impactful roles at Qualcomm, where I worked on cutting-edge machine learning projects, as well as various side ventures where I sharpened my full-stack development skills.

I'm committed to leveraging technology to create solutions that can impact millions, with a particular focus on deep tech, AI, SaaS, and fintech. With a solid engineering foundation and a knack for turning ideas into scalable businesses, I thrive on exploring new ventures that push the boundaries of innovation.

Whether it's building micro SaaS products or designing AI-based tools, my ultimate goal is to create technology that improves people's lives. Check out my projects section to learn more, and feel free to explore my blogs—I'm working on becoming more consistent with them. Let's connect and build the future together!
