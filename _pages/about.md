Hello! I’m currently pursuing my education at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) at the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web). I’m in my final year of the Dual Degree course: BTech + MTech in Communication and Signal Processing.

My field of interest lies in Stochastic Controls, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, and Signal (especially Music) Processing. I’m working on Automatic Music Generation for my Dual Degree Thesis under [Prof. Preeti Rao](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/prao).

I intend on sharing my projects and, at times, some other interesting research papers and topics I come across through the blog section of this website.
